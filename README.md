# Project Title

## Introduction

Welcome to the Trail Project! This project serves as a learning exercise to delve into web development basics, including HTML, CSS, README creation, Git version control, and code linting.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to familiarize ourselves with fundamental web technologies by creating a simple webpage styled with CSS. Additionally, we'll explore best practices for project documentation by creating a README file, utilizing Git's .gitignore feature, and integrating code linting for improved code quality.

## Features

- **Simple Webpage**: Display a basic webpage with the text "HelloWkuCs".
- **Styling with CSS**: Apply CSS styling to enhance the appearance of the webpage.
- **README**: Create a comprehensive README file to provide project overview and setup instructions.
- **Git Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control, including a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
- **Code Linting**: Integrate linters for HTML and CSS to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the webpage.
3. Use your preferred linter setup to check HTML and CSS files for code quality.
4. Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to understand the structure and styling of the webpage.
5. Check out the README file for more detailed information about the project.
